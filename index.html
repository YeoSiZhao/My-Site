        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <p> 
            I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering in National University of Singapore (NUS).
        </p>
        <p> I am deeply passionate about delving into the ever-evolving technical fields, driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to continually learn and innovate. Computer engineering captivates me with its unique ability to bridge the gap between hardware and software, empowering me to design seamless, efficient, and transformative solutions. This interdisciplinary field allows me to explore the intricacies of system design, optimize performance, and develop cutting-edge applications that address real-world challenges. I am enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of technology, using my skills to shape a more connected and intelligent future while continually expanding my knowledge and capabilities.
        </p>
        <p> As part of my Y1S1 winter break, I am starting this journey to document what I have learnt so far as a side project!

        <h3> CG1111A </h3>
        <p> This course is the first of the two Engineering Principles and Practice (EPP) courses taken by computer engineering students, which aim to inculcate our way of thinking. We are first taught the fundamental principles of electronic circuits through experiential learning, along which we also build up our hands-on circuit designing, building, and debugging skills. We are then guided to apply these principles and skills to build a sensor-assisted autonomous robotic vehicle as a grand finale challenge. Upon completing the course, we learn to appreciate the importance of circuits, signals, and sensors in system implementation.
        </p>
        <p>The mBot robot finale project - "The A-maze-ing Race.", required us to design and construct an mBot robot capable of efficiently navigating a maze within the shortest possible time. 
    
            The maze presented challenges in the form of colored tiles, indicating the next direction for the robot. These tiles came in various colors, namely red, orange, green, blue, and purple. Each color instructed the robot to perform a specific type of turn to successfully traverse the maze. 
            
            The maze featured walls that the robot had to avoid while moving towards the waypoint challenges, signified by black strips on the floor. These challenges required the robot to execute turns based on the color of the tile, adding complexity to the navigation process.</p>

        <h3> UTW1001T </h3>
        <p> As part of the University Town College Programme (UTCP), I took up this module to broaden my horizons of Philosophy writing. Designed as a more coherent delivery of general education, the UTCP emphasises multidisciplinary learning and active small-group learning. Students from different disciplines, cultures, and nationalities are put together in each class, which helps them to assimilate and synthesise cross-disciplinary knowledge, facilitating multi-perspectival thinking.

        <p> Is it wrong for eight men to have as much wealth as 3.6 billion people? If so, what should we do about it? This course offers a deep dive into the nature and ethics of wealth inequality. It has two parts. We first address a theoretical question: When, if ever, is inequality morally wrong? This lays the foundation for the second part, where we examine the causes and consequences of wealth inequality, along with possible responses. The aim is to critically examine our attitudes and policies as we strive for a just and practical distribution of wealth.</p>
